# netflix-data-analysis
This project explores and analyzes the Netflix Titles Dataset to uncover insights about content distribution, upload patterns, and platform trends. Using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib, the analysis examines how Netflix’s catalog has evolved over the years and how various factors influence content strategy.

The project includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualizations that highlight key findings such as:

Dominance of the United States, followed by India and the United Kingdom, in content production.

A clear imbalance where the number of movies significantly exceeds the number of TV shows.

A sharp rise in uploads between 2015 and 2019, reflecting Netflix’s rapid global expansion and increased internet accessibility.

This analysis provides an overview of Netflix’s evolving content strategy and helps understand how regional influence, content type, and time trends shape its platform growth.
